Kubernetes in the Cloud
=======================

We'll take the Kubernetes resources we built previously and run them in Azure. You're welcome to run on Amazon, Google Cloud, Cloud Foundry, or any other hosted Kubernetes environment, though you'll likely need to modify the instructions a bit.

The cloud vendors upgrade their systems constantly, so you may find differences in instructions and screen shots.  If you do, let me know, and we'll update the courseware to match.
